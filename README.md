<h1>dont use this lol</h1>
<p>my script (made with help from gpt) to get fedora running the way i like it when reinstalling or installing on another computer</p>
<p>havent tested yet but in theory it should:
    <p>1. install zsh</p>
    <p>2. install zsh bira theme</p>
    <p>3. install all of my apps like nvim and nano + steam.</p></p>
<h3>script is open source blah blah blah</h3>
